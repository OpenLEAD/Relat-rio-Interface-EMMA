abstract = {ABSTRACT: Cognitive engineering needs viable constructs and principles to promote$\backslash$nbetter understanding and prediction of human performance in complex systems.$\backslash$nThree human cognition and performance constructs that have been the subjects of$\backslash$nmuch attention in research and practice over the past three decades are situation$\backslash$nawareness (SA), mental workload, and trust in automation. Recently, Dekker and$\backslash$nWoods (2002) and Dekker and Hollnagel (2004; henceforth DWH) argued that these$\backslash$nconstructs represent “folk models” without strong empirical foundations and lacking$\backslash$nscientific status. We counter this view by presenting a brief description of the large$\backslash$nscience base of empirical studies on these constructs. We show that the constructs$\backslash$ncan be operationalized using behavioral, physiological, and subjective measures,$\backslash$nsupplemented by computational modeling, but that the constructs are also distinct$\backslash$nfrom human performance. DWH also caricatured as “abracadabra” a framework$\backslash$nsuggested by us to address the problem of the design of automated systems$\backslash$n(Parasuraman, Sheridan, {\&} Wickens, 2000). We point to several factual and conceptual$\backslash$nerrors in their description of our approach. Finally, we rebut DWH’s view that SA,$\backslash$nmental workload, and trust represent folk concepts that are not falsifiable. We$\backslash$nconclude that SA, mental workload, and trust are viable constructs that are valuable in$\backslash$nunderstanding and predicting human-system performance in complex systems.},
